# godot-4.5-deformating-cube-with-noise
A simple Godot 4.5 code with a rotating 3D cube, deformating and with a purple waving noise on it.
<br>
You can use and modify for any use. 

## Example scene
You can move the camera with the mouse and move yourself with WASD, ZQSD or arrow keys. Space to go up. Ctrl to go down. Escape to quit mouse mode

## .exe and gif of rendering
To see more easily the result (for example if you don't have Godot), you can download the .exe folder (make sure to download each element of this folder). <br> If you don't want to download the .exe, <br>
here is a gif (please note that the gif is laggy, due to the conversion of mp4 to gif, so we recommend to download the folder) <br>
